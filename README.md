These files were used in the presentation "Julia for Robotics" at the [2017 MIT Robocon](http://robocon.mit.edu/speakers.html#breakout) by Professor Alan Edelman (@alanedelman), Twan Koolen @tkoolen, and Robin Deits @rdeits. 

To follow along with the presentation, take a look at the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` folder.
